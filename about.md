Kimberley Barker was born in a condemned hospital in a foreign country, where she was burned by a cigarette-smoking nurse. Despite this rough start in life, Kimberley eventually became Anne Shirley, a Maine Coon cat, and freshly-baked scones. After a lot of life disappointments, she evolved into a honey badger and Wednesday Addams, and was sorted into Hufflepuff. After a brief stint as both a unicorn and Daria Morgendorffer, Kimberley became a tired, middle-aged working mother,who now identifies as Grumpy Cat, Phil Coulson, and Irish Breakfast tea. 

Jason was programmed to destroy, but after a freak plasma storm melded his Integrated Murder Unit into his Auxilary Systems Control Panel, he paridoxically turned against his creators and became obsessed with stars, frogs, Calvin & Hobbes, ninja flips, climbing trees, video games, caramel, and philosophy. He recharges on mountain tops using a combination of wind, solar, and inspiring-grand-vista power. Until his power cells deplete and his components are downcycled into moderately priced Smart Kitchen appliances, he hopes to do good in the world and learn what it means to love.
