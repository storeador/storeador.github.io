Snappy throwaway lines, compelling and colorful shot composition, a many-tentacled apocalypse, and kittens: Hellboy has it all.

Hellboy (the first one, since there is no second one because it doesn't exist) is one of Kimberley and Jason's favorite movies.  When an army of mediocre superhero movies go bump in the night, Hellboy is the one that bumps back.
