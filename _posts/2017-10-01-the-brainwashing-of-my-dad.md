Kimberley and Jason decide to start a rival Fox News station that shows news about adorable foxes 24/7. 

This documentary shows how Fox News and Right Wing Talk Radio posess the mind of the director's otherwise mild-mannered and kind father, turning him into a scowling, vitriol-spewing distortion of his former self. Like many of the interviewees in the movie, this story is all to familiar to Kimberley, and all too painful. Jason hypothesizes about how to oppose the lumbering war machine of Right Wing Media. Both hosts end up in the fetal position, holding small talismen of Mr. Universe from Serenity.
