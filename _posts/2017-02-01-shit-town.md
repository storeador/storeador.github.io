A small town in Alabama. An eccentric genius with a hedgemaze, who makes his living restoring antique clocks. Buried gold. Repressed sexuality. Murder?

Like many, Kimberley and Jason loved, loved, loved S-Town. In their discussion, they talk about growing up in the South, their Podcast-Host Crush on Brian Reed, and whether or not John McLemore was a 21st century Nostradamus or a guy who breathed too many metal fumes. Did we mention we loved S-Town? We really loved S-Town.
