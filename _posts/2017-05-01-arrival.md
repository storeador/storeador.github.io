Aliens, Amy Adams, anti-gravity, the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and whiteboards. 

Arrival- We discuss the 2016 movie "Arrival", which was directed by Denis Villeneuve, and starred Amy Adams and Jeremy Renner. 
Kimberley reveals that she absolutely doesn't want to know the future, misremembers the Golden Ratio, and states accurately that there's a lot of blue in the film. Jason nerds out on language design, analyzes the OSHA-approved best practices for aerial work platforms and how they are sometimes necessarily ignored in service of great cinematography, and makes many pseudo-intellectual comments about the experience of watching the film twice and enjoying it the second time (despite knowing the plot, aka "the Heptapod Way").
