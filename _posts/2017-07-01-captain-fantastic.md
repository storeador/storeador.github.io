Power to the People! Stick it to the Man!

In this episode, it's parenting on steroids as Jason and Kimberley discuss the 2016 film "Captain Fantastic"! This film really struck a chord with Kimberley, and she expresses ALL of her emotions about parenting. We also make judgy statements about Today's Youth / Consumer Culture / Modern Education / The Many Distractions of Digitally Connected Living (not including podcasts, of course).  Jason recounts growing up semi-feral in the wilds of Virginia and his first confrontation with modern civilization in the form of a urinal (the urinal won).
