John Cheever's 1964 short story "The Swimmer" traces the path of one man's mental breakdown, and, wow, is it a doozy. We guarantee a roller coaster of emotions (contempt for the bourgeoisie! confusion about what the heck is actually happening! sadness at the decline of not just one man, but of all of us!), and the witty repartee that you've come to expect from your hosts. Jason tries his best to say the phrase, "the disintegration of all things" as many times as possible, causing Kimberley's patience to steadily disintegrate as the episode goes on.
