Everybody loves "Hamilton", and your hosts are no exception! 
We discuss our own experiences with learning history, and talk about why kids these days don't know how good they have it. We also touch on why hip-hop is the perfect genre to represent the American Revolution, and Kimberley does a lot of very bad singing. 
Join us in the room where (our podcast) happens as we discuss our favorite moments from Lin-Manuel Miranda's 2016 tour de force.
