Stories draw us in, play our emotions, and sometimes kill us (metaphorically, please). On the sToreador Podcast, we invite you to participate in our bi-weekly conversation about movies, short stories, poetry, musicals, concept albums, graphic novels, and even other podcasts. We select stories we love or stories we've been meaning to explore and give ourselves (and you!) two weeks to watch, read, or listen to them. With a few exceptions, we try to select stories you can experience in three hours or less. Think of it as a low-key book club for all forms of media. We encourage you to take in each episode's story before listening to the podcast, as we are definitely full of spoilers. And we encourage you doubly to participate in the conversation via social media! We hope you enjoy these stories we adore.
